I chose Option 2 for this Project.
This is a short Art History Quiz App with a Login and Registration Screen.
To be completely I was too ambitious with this idea originally and it all fell apart so it was condensed to the material seen in the code currently. 

The main components in this app is the Registration/Log-in Screen, the Artists Screen that you can click on two different artists to learn more about, and the timed quiz. The quiz will give you your score either when the user finishes the questions OR when the time runs out.
